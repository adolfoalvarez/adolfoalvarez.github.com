Welcome to my website!. My name is Adolfo Álvarez, and currently you can find me at <a href="http://www.o-i.com" target="_blank">O-I</a>, where I am part of a great team of analysts and data scientists who will extract valuable information from your data.

I got a degree in Industrial Engineering at <a href="http://www.ingenieriaindustrial.usach.cl/" target="_blank"> Universidad de Santiago de Chile</a>, and later I moved to Spain where I completed my PhD in Business Management and Quantitative Methods at <a href="http://www.est.uc3m.es" target="_blank">Universidad Carlos III de Madrid</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://www.est.uc3m.es/dpena" target ="_blank">Daniel Peña</a>. I am interested in the theory and practise of data analysis, under this umbrella you can find many different names pointing to the same concept: business intelligence, statistical (or machine) learning, multivariate statistics, etc... You can find more details about my research interests in the CV section <a href="/cv">here </a>

Once I was asked if I had another hobby besides <a href="http://www.r-project.org/" target = "_blank">R</a> (a.k.a. #rstats), and actually I have: Social networks, photography, travelling, and discovering new places in old cities, but developing R models takes up most of my time at work and some of my free time. In the "Articles" section you can find some thoughts, examples, and pieces of R code that have been useful for me, so I think is worth to share.

If you are interested in contact me, please send me an email to "adalvarez" within the domain gmail.com, or write me in twitter: <a href="http://www.twitter.com/adolfoalvarez" target="_blank">@adolfoalvarez</a> or let's connect in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adolfoalvarez" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
